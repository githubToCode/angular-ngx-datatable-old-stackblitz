Done, view update on resize.

for now I kept resize width as 400 and less, you can change that by updating 'minimumSizeViewWidth' value.

Hevy rains, WFH today. Started working on it...

I think its problem with typescript version 3 , I use 2 and ,may be because of that the compilation errror is not going, I could able to replicate in this repo by downgrading the typescript version to 2.9.2

Just download this repo and execute locally, u will see the error
